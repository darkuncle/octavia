<h1><a href="/octavia/">Octavia</a>: Architecture</h1>

<p><em>By Chris Palmer (<a
href="http://noncombatant.org/">noncombatant.org</a>), 28 May 2010<br/>

Slightly amended after valuable help from Zooko O’Whielacronx (see
below), 28 May 2010</em></p>

<p>TODO: Explain why we don’t (or do?) need an all-or-nothing transform.
Consider borrowing Tahoe-LAFS’ combined ciphers technique.</p>

<p>This document (very) informally describes the Octavia protocol. Octavia
is a decentralized network data storage system that aims to provide the
security guarantees of <em>confidentiality</em>, <em>integrity</em>, and
<em>availability</em> against internet threats.</p>

<p>Clients should experience high availability regardless of the
availability or policy of any particular server. Servers and active and
passive network attackers have no chance to adversely affect confidentiality
and integrity without breaking the cryptographic functions.  Depending on
their situation relative to the client and the client’s servers, network
attackers will have more or less opportunity to adversely affect
availability and performance.</p>

<p>Octavia makes no attempt to defeat traffic analysis attacks; however,
Octavia could be transported over an overlay or proxy network such as Tor to
provide this feature.</p>

<p>Octavia provides its security guarantees regardless of transport. I
designed Octavia with UDP in mind, but TCP (with message pipelining) also
seems plausible (and necessary for use with Tor).</p>

<p>This document focuses primarily on the local and network data structures
that enable the system to work; I do not describe the processes that operate
on the structures because I hope they are mostly obvious. However, they may
not be. <tt>:)</tt></p>


<h2>File and Directory Descriptors</h2>

<h3>Segment</h3>

<p>Files are <em>streams</em> of bytes, broken up into arbitrarily-sized
<em>segments</em>. (Segments will usually be of some consistent size,
perhaps related to the link’s maximum transfer unit.) Segments are encrypted
with a per-directory encryption-key before transmission.</p>

<p>Clients store their file segments on as many servers as they like. They
can later retrieve segments of a given file from any combination of servers
that have a copy of the segment. (In some deployments, it might even make
sense to simply broadcast get-requests.)</p>

<pre>
ciphertext(plaintext) := {
      iv
      aes-128-cbc(encryption-key, iv, plaintext)
}

segment-id(ciphertext) := {
      size(ciphertext)
      sha-512-d(ciphertext)
}
</pre>

<h3>File Descriptor</h3>

<pre>
type := file
type := directory

file-descriptor := {
      type
      name
      mtime
      segment-id ...
}
</pre>

<h3>Directory Descriptor</h3>

<p>Directory descriptors are stored as regular files in the Octavia
filesystem. Only the root descriptor is delivered out-of-band; once a client
has its root descriptor, it can dynamically discover, retrieve, verify, and
decrypt the descriptors of all file and directory children of the root.</p>

<p>Because each directory has a different encryption key, the minimal unit
of read-sharing is the subtree. Any directory descriptor could be mounted as
a root. For example, imagine that Zooko wants to share his archive of
cryptography papers with the world. He would create a new subdirectory
underneath his own Octavia root (or create a completely new Octavia root),
populate it with documents and (optionally) subdirectories, and then publish
it on his web site. Anyone can retrieve the descriptor, mount it in a
directory on their system, and now browse the entire crypto document
subtree. Zooko’s friends would download the root descriptor and mount it as
follows (assuming an unfortunately still-hypothetical Octavia implementation
called <var>8va</var>):</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>wget https://zooko.com/crypto-papers.8va &gt; crypto-papers.8va</strong>
$ <strong>8va crypto-papers.8va ~/8va-mounts/crypto-papers</strong>
</pre>

<p>Note that the guarantee of confidentiality is lost in this
case&#x200a;—&#x200a;the documents are publically
readable&#x200a;—&#x200a;because the descriptor is public. If Zooko wanted
to maintain confidentiality, he would need to ensure that only his closest
friends were able to retrieve the descriptor (perhaps by password-protecting
the web resource, or only sending it in PGP-encrypted email, or some similar
mechanism).</p>

<p>It is similarly a good idea for users to back up copies of their own root
descriptors and the signing keys they have shared with servers, using secure
means such as PGP, SSH, or USB keys in a safe. A directory descriptor is
necessary and sufficient to discover, verify, retrieve, and decrypt all
children of the directory. The signing keys are necessary and sufficient to
write and delete segments on servers. With nothing but their root descriptor
and their signing keys, you can completely recover your Octavia data.</p>

<p>Once mounted, a user can create new, private versions of a tree. The new
segments can only be stored on servers with which the client has
registrations, which may or may not overlap with the servers Zooko’s client
has its own registrations with.</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>mkdir ~/8va-mounts/crypto-papers/my-additions</strong>
$ <strong>cp some-cool-paper.pdf ~/8va-mounts/crypto-papers/my-additions</strong>
</pre>

<p>An Octavia directory tree is <em>persistent</em> (or <em>functional</em>,
or <em>immutable</em>); that is, an update to a node creates a new version
of that node without destroying the old version and without affecting other
readers of the object. The update also incurs new versions of all parent
nodes up to the root. (This is necessary so that the parent can describe the
new version of the child.) Thus, all previous versions of all files and
directories remain available, enabling a “snapshot” feature.  (However, a
particular server’s garbage collection, quota, or liveness policies may
result in the unavailability of some segments. Server policy may be
influenced by delete-requests.)</p>

<p>Each directory descriptor contains a list of servers that are known to
have stored segments of its immediate children. Segment retrieval is
unauthenticated.</p>

<p>To store new segments on a server, clients must have a pre-arranged
relationship (a <em>registration</em>) with the server. Clients and servers
authenticate each other by verifying symmetric signatures made with the
signing key. Segment storage and deletion are authenticated.</p>

<pre>
server := hostname:port
server := ip-address:port

directory-descriptor := {
      encryption-key
      mtime
      version
      server ...
      file-descriptor ...
}
</pre>


<h2>Protocol Messages</h2>

<p>All currently-defined protocol messages concern the transfer and status
of segments. Support protocols, such as for notifying other clients about
updates to shared directories, registering clients with servers, and
deliverying root directory descriptors, are not yet specified.</p>

<p>The protocol is largely stateless; the client needs to maintain a table
of pending put and delete requests (identified by their <em>nonce</em> or
<em>transaction-id</em>).</p>

<p>Although it may seem that clients need to maintain a table of pending
get-requests, in fact a get-response identifies itself. Because the client
must verify the response data anyway (by recalculating the segment-id given
the data in hand), it thereby learns what request the response is for.
Clients simply ignore redundant or damaged responses. (In fact both clients
and servers ignore any message they don’t like, whatever the reason.)
Clients should retry requests (possibly to different servers) in the event
of unsatisfactory responses, or if no response arrives after a timeout.</p>

<p>Zooko is correct that have-{request,response} seem unnecessary and
bloaty. And there is no guarantee that servers will honor delete-requests,
either. The first draft of Octavia did not include these four message types,
but I added them later as a premature hinting mechanism for hypothetical
optimizations. Implementors MAY laugh them off.</p>

<h2>Zooko’s Comments</h2>

</div>

<p>These are in roughly descending order of importance.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>It seems wrong for the nonce to be omitted from the signed data in
the requests. An attacker can send requests to server with legitimate
signatures (copied from legitimate messages) but supply their own nonce,
thus getting the signature of the server on that nonce. They can do so more
than once for a given legitimate signature. They could then wait until the
next time the client issues a request that has a nonce, intercept that
message, copy that nonce and get the server to sign that nonce with their
old copy of some previous legitimate message's client-signature, and thus
fool the client into thinking the server has positively acknowledged their
latest request.

<p>Including the nonce in the signature in the request should fix this, but
why not put <em>all</em> of the fields of the request under the signature
for those message types where a signature is required? There could be other
problems like this one with the other unsigned fields. If we don't put them
under the signature then we should think carefully about whether they are
okay.</li>

<li>Versioning of Octavia protocols/data formats; If I'm an Octavia version
2 client and I'm downloading something, I might need to be able to tell
whether the server that I'm talking to is an Octavia version 1 server or an
Octavia version 2 server. I also might need to be able to tell whether the
thing I'm downloading was uploaded by an Octavia version 1 client or an
Octavia version 2 client. In addition it might be useful if there were a way
for Octavia version 2 software to put data into the messages or the
descriptors which they knew that Octavia version 1 software would always
ignore, such as by specifying that Octavia version 1 software is supposed to
ignore all fields higher than the known fields (if fields are numbered), or
ignore all fields with unrecognized names (if fields are named).</li>

<li><p>You could sort the entries in the directory and put an index at the
beginning of the directory showing which entries begin at which character
within the directory. This would allow efficiently fetching just the entry
that you want. The extreme case would be a large directory of large files
when you only are interested in the file that occurs at the end of the
directory. The even more extreme case would be a chain of children with that
same pattern. :-)</li>

<li><p>There isn't a way within this spec to know which response is the
response to which request, for those message pairs that don't have a nonce
("no-authorization-required" messages). One could do that at a different
layer, such as by putting the request in an HTTP request and the associated
response in the associated HTTP response, or by putting them in order on a
TCP stream.  If they are not delivered over such a transport but instead
over an order-non-preserving transport such as UDP then we could get
accidental mismatches.</p>

<p>Even if they are delivered over an order-preserving (or at least
pair-preserving) transport, malicious active attackers could reorder those
messages to make the client think the wrong one was the response to a given
request. As far as I can see this would not compromise confidentiality or
integrity but could be a denial-of-service.</p>

<p>It appears to be Octavia's design to rely on some external tools for such
things, such as by running Octavia over SSL/TLS or SSH so that attackers
can't reorder the data.</p>

<p>It might be useful to include a sequence number or nonce on the
no-authorization-required message pairs to avoid accidental mismatches on
unreliable transports, and to facilitate matching on secure unreliable
transports, reliable transports, and secure reliable transports.</p>

<p>It might be wise in some eventual more detailed spec to warn the
implementor not to assume that the no-authorization-required responses are
properly paired with their requests unless she is using such a secure
transport layer.</p></li>

<li><p>Have you considered including in the directory descriptor a more
detailed mapping of which specific servers have which specific segments?
That could optimize out a round trip in the case that not all servers were
given all segments, but that every server that was given a segment still has
it. In that case--the case where the directory descriptor tells you exactly
which servers had which segments, then you wouldn't use the
<var>have-request</var> message at all, but would send get-requests right
away. <var>have-request</var> would remain useful for the case that you
don't know exactly who was supposed to have the segments (perhaps the
directory doesn't say, or the set of servers that it lists aren't reachable
by you but lots of other servers are).</p>

<p>Server selection: does the uploader upload all the segments redundantly
to multiple servers or upload only a subset of the segments to each server?
What if the number of servers he has registrations with is greater than the
number of servers he wants to upload to, so he has to choose a subset of the
servers--which subset should he choose? Of course it is good to write a spec
that is independent of this sort of strategy on the uploaders part, as you
have done. The only problem is that for efficiency the downloader needs to
be able to decide which servers to download which segments from without
having to query lots of servers about what segments they actually
have...</p>

<p>Oh, wait a minute, I get it. The uploader is supposed to upload all
segments to each server normally. The <var>have-request</var> message is
probably normally useless--a downloader could start using a
<var>have-request</var> once it realizes that the expected way of doing
things has failed. But it would seem more consistent with Octavia's design
to omit <var>have-request</var> entirely and require the uploader to produce
a new <var>directory-descriptor</var> and the downloader to acquire the new
<var>directory-descriptor</var> in such cases, such as if the segments are
now stored on new servers and no longer on the old servers, or if many of
the segments have been lost from some of the servers.</p>

<p>Omitting <var>have-request</var> would thus simplify the spec by making
it obvious that the downloader relies on the uploader to provide a
descriptor describing good servers.</p></li>

<li><p><var>have-request</var> needs a boolean value indicating whether I
had or didn't have the droid you were looking for.</li>

<li><p>What is <var>version</var> in <var>directory-descriptor</var>?
(Guess: something that identifies which version of this directory, an
arbitrary string which is by convention the decimal representation of an
incrementing non-negative integer?)</li>

<li><p>Does <var>server</var> need an optional port number?</li>

<li><p>Good stuff! :-) Simple and secure! Nice narrow scope by excluding
mutability, notifications of updates, and registration.</li>
