<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Why is it called “Octavia”?</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler">Octavia E.
Butler</a> was a groundbreaking author of science fiction and other novels
notable for their complex and nuanced perspectives on race, power, and
gender; at the same time, she inspired people with her magnificent
imagination. Butler achieved all this in short but dense stories that reward
multiple readings.</p>


<h2>Client</h2>

<h3>Can I use Octavia as a backup system?</h3>

<p>Future Octavia clients will keep track of a configurable number of
directory descriptor versions, enabling a feature like FreeBSD/NetApp/Plan 9
“snapshots”: old versions of your files will still be available
in a .snapshot directory. Since the directories and files are stored on many
servers, including old versions, that may be good enough for you as a
recoverable backup system.</p>

<p>If that is not good enough for you, you will still be able to use
whatever other backup system you prefer along with your Octavia
filesystem.</p>

<h3>Why doesn’t Octavia support POSIX permissions or NT ACLs?</h3>

<p>Unix UIDs/GIDs and NT SIDs are local concepts, valid no more widely than
a single domain (e.g. an Active Directory or LDAP domain). Even on such a
small scale, these domain management systems are not known for security.
Octavia is a secure internet filesystem, and so implements access control in
the only way that scales globally: cryptography.</p>

<p>Each directory has a distinct encryption key, which the client uses to
encrypt the files and directory descriptors contained within. Thus, the
directory subtree is the unit of read access sharing. Each client has
symmetric signing key relationships with one or more servers, allowing that
client the ability to write blocks to the server. It’s up to the
client to organize those blocks into files and directories, including
possibly new versions (“forks”) of directory subtrees shared
from another client.</p>

<p>The server has no notion of files or directories, only blocks of
ciphertext, and thus cannot enforce any permission other than block
writes, and rate-limiting block reads by IP address.</p>

<h3>Does Octavia support file locking?</h3>

<p>No. Each write is a new, independent version (fork) of the original file
or directory. Octavia files and directories are <em>purely functional</em>
(or <em>persistent</em>) trees (see <a
href="references.html#okasaki-functional">Okasaki</a>).</p>

<h3>Does Octavia support memory-mapped I/O?</h3>

<p>Even a true Octavia client in your OS kernel is probably not going to
support memory-mapped I/O (such as with the <em>mmap</em>(2) or
<em>MapViewOfFile</em> system calls) particularly efficiently.</p>

<p>The lack of file or region locking and efficient mapped I/O make Octavia
a bad choice for storing database files. In that regard, Octavia is no worse
or better than existing network filesystems like CIFS and NFS.</p>

<h2>Server</h2>

<h3>What are some examples of server policies?</h3>

<h2>Security</h2>

<h3>Why is there no cipher suite negotiation?</h3>

<p>Other cryptographic network protocols like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> include nifty
mechanisms allowing clients and servers to negotiate security parameters
such as cipher algorithm, block cipher mode, key exchange protocol, and
integrity protection algorithm. This is a great idea because cryptographic
functions have a disturbing tendency to be exposed as broken over time (for
example, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">DES</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a>). Making the protocol
flexible allows deployers and developers to configure new, hopefully-safer
security parameters.</p>

<p>However, the flexibility comes at the high cost of increased protocol and
code complexity. Complexity is a leading cause of bugs, including security
vulnerabilities. (See <a
href="references.html#ferguson-schneier-practical">Ferguson and
Schneier</a>, section 1.2 “The Evils of Features”.) SSL version
2, for example, had a security downgrade vulnerability in its negotiation
(see <a href="references.html#wagner-schneier-ssl3">Wagner and
Schneier</a>). Similarly, SSH endpoints supporting both SSH 1 and 2 can be
downgraded by an active network attacker (see <a
href="references.html#click-death-mitm">Click Death Squad</a>; note that the
Squad specifies that the attacker have a cold beer on hand but that tawny
port works just as well).</p>

<p>The increased complexity manifests as increased cognitive load for
users&#x200A;—&#x200A;in order to make the right choice, people have to
understand the problem and the options. To expect normal people to make the
right choice between SHA-1, Tiger, and Whirlpool is unrealistic and plainly
silly.</p>

<p>Additionally, for people to deploy a new, more secure cipher, they have
to get a new version of the application supporting the new cipher. (If they
had the good cipher in their old version, why would they choose to use the
bad cipher?) Thus, people have to wait for a safe upgrade in any case.</p>

<p>This leaves compatibility with non-upgraded peers as a key reason to make
the protocol flexible. But why would we want to converse with
known-vulnerable peers? How would we avoid downgrade attacks?</p>

<p>Instead, Octavia ties security functions tightly to the protocol version.
Each protocol version uses believed-strong security functions; for example,
version 0 uses AES-128-CBC, SHA-256, and HMAC-SHA-256. As far as we know in
late 2009, these functions provide something close to 128-bit security,
which even if slightly weakened should be sufficient for the medium-term
future (see <a href="references.html#ferguson-schneier-practical">Ferguson
and Schneier</a>, section 3.7 “Security Level”).</p>

<h3>What if one of the algorithms is broken?</h3>

<p>If someone finds a weakness in one of these functions and/or in the
Octavia protocol itself, we will develop a new protocol version and
implementation(s) to address the problem(s). Particular client and server
implementations can provide more or less configuration flexibility, and
deployers can deploy the implementations and versions they feel comfortable
with.</p>


<h3>Does Octavia defend against traffic analysis?</h3>

<p>Octavia makes no attempt to defeat <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis">traffic analysis
attacks</a>. This is unfortunate, because traffic analysis is a powerful
attack technique. It is also incredibly difficult to defend against.<p>

<p>While there is a beautiful system designed to defend against traffic
analysis, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, at this time Tor
can only work with TCP streams. Octavia uses UDP datagrams for all its
transport.</p>

<p>Sorry about that.</p>

<p>It is possible that Tor may support UDP or even IP someday (see <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2007/msg00069.html">this message
from Nick Mathewson</a> and <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#TransportIPnotTCP">this
Tor FAQ entry</a>), but it’s not going to be easy.</p>
