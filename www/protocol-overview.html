<h1><a href="index.html"><img src="8va.png" alt="Octavia" width="105" height="56" /></a>: Protocol Overview</h1>

<p>This document explains some of the protocol interactions between an
Octavia client and its server(s). It is not yet complete, and many possible
scenarios are not yet documented.</p>

<h2>Storing a Block</h2>

<p>To store a file, the Octavia client breaks the file up into fixed-size
blocks. (The last block may not be a full block in length.) Octavia encrypts
the block, and then calculates a cryptographic hash on the ciphertext of the
block. This hash is the <em>block ID</em>. The client then uses its signing
key(s) to sign storage requests, and sends the requests to servers. Because
the client may have different signing key relationships with different
servers, it may have to formulate and sign several requests.</p>

<p>Servers verify the signature, which allows them to know whether the
client is authorized to store blocks. The server can apply any policy at
this time, such as space usage quotas, random denial, et c. If the server
agrees to store the block, it crafts and signs a storage response with the
same key, and sends the response to the client. If not, it does not send any
message.</p>

<h2>Retrieving a Block</h2>

<p>Clients may ask any number of servers for a block they need, and those
servers can choose to respond or not on any schedule they like. The client
may choose to ask many servers all at once, and use the response of the
first server to respond correctly. Clients check that the has of the
incoming block contents match the requested block ID, and simply ignore
invalid responses.</p>

<p>Servers may also ignore block retrieval requests. Clients anticipate this
and either ask many servers, or ask the same or other servers after a
timeout.</p>
