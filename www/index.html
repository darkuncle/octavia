</div>

<p>Octavia is a secure, decentralized network filesystem.  Although there
are already many network filesystems, such as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">Common Internet
Filesystem</a> (also called “<a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>”),
Sun’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29">Network
File System</a>, and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">Apple Filing
Protocol</a>, they are unsafe for use on the wider Internet. (In fact, they
are unsafe for all but the smallest, physically private networks, as well.)
By contrast, Octavia aims to provide specific security and reliability
guarantees while still providing good performance and usability.</p>

<p>In particular, most existing network filesystems rely on a single central
<em>file server</em> computer to serve data to many client computers.  This
centralization is both a strength and a weakness: while it is easy to
understand and develop a centralized system, it proves brittle in practice.
If the server becomes overloaded or crashes, client performance becomes
degraded or even completely unavailable. It is often (but not necessarily)
the case that people must place complete trust in the central server as
well: if the server is compromised, people can no longer be certain that
their data has not been accessed by the attacker.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.allmydata.org/">Tahoe-LAFS</a> filesystem most
closely resembles Octavia: it shares Octavia’s goals of security and
reliability. Octavia aims to explore different design alternatives in the
same problem space. For other significant work in this area, perhaps most
notably including <a href="references.html#mazieres-sfs">SFS</a>, see the <a
href="references.html">references page</a>.</p>


<h2>How Is Octavia Secure?</h2></a>

<div id="sec-how-secure">

<p>Octavia provides four crucial security guarantees. We currently know of
no network filesystem besides Tahoe-LAFS that claims to provide these
guarantees.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Before sending data to the Octavia
server, the Octavia client encrypts the data in such a way that only the
client itself can decrypt it. The server cannot decrypt the data, nor can
any other user. The client only ever sends the encrypted form of the data
over the internet. The confidentiality of the client’s data is thus
protected from servers and from eavesdroppers on the internet.</p>

<p>The encryption function is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation">cipher
block chaining</a> (CBC) mode with a cryptographically random key and a
unique, cryptographically random initialization vector (IV) created for each
encryption operation. Each directory of files has its own cryptographically
random key.</li>

<li><p><strong>Integrity.</strong> In addition to encrypting the data when
storing data on the server, the client also computes a cryptographic <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">message
authentication code (MAC)</a> over the data. The signature is created with a
secret <em>signing key</em> that only the client and the server share; the
key is necessary to compute the signature. Thus, the server and the client
can verify that the data has not been damaged in transit over the network,
and that only the true client or server could have signed it.</p>

<p>The MAC function is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC-SHA-512</a>, again with a
cryptographically random symmetric key. The key is pre-shared, out of band,
between client and server in some server-defined protocol.</p>

<p>When reading data from servers, clients ask for <em>segments</em> of data
identified by a <em>cryptographic hash</em> of the data itself. When the
servers respond, clients check that the hash is correct by re-computing the
hash for the received data. It is (believed to be) computationally
infeasible to forge these hashes or to find two segments with the same hash
value, so clients can trust that servers have sent the correct data and that
no attacker has damaged the data in transit.</p>

<p>The cryptographic hash is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions">SHA-512d</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Authentication.</strong> Since the client and the server
share the signing key, they can verify that a signed block of data could
only have been signed by a computer that has the secret key installed.
Octavia uses this feature to enable servers to ensure that incoming data are
sent by authorized clients, and to enable clients to know that the true
server received the client's request.</p>

<p>Servers can implement essentially arbitrary policies and arbitrary client
registration protocols. They can leverage centralized AAA systems like
Active Directory, they can accept anonymous clients, they can enforce
per-client quotas, and so on. Clients can interact with many servers
implementing many policies, transparently&#x200A;—&#x200A;in fact, clients
generally have no understanding of server policy at all, except
indirectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Availability.</strong> Octavia clients can store copies of
their data on many servers. Ideally, people will configure their clients to
store copies of their data on servers that are distributed in many different
locations, thus providing protection against various types of calamity: bad
weather, natural disasters, power outages, human errors, et c.</p>

<p>Octavia simply copies the entire data to many servers, making no use of
clever techniques such as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">erasure coding</a> to
provide efficient redundancy. Although space-inefficient and not as reliable
for the money as erasure coding, this approach is time-efficient, simple to
implement and to understand, requires only simple configuration, and
maximizes read parallelism (any valid response from any server satisfies the
request).</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>What About Decentralization?</h2></a>

<div id="sec-decentralization">

<p>Octavia is designed to be deployed on the internet. Since the internet
has no centralized authority, Octavia does not rely on one. Octavia clients
and servers can associate and disassociate on an ad hoc basis. Clients don’t
depend on any particular server, and servers are thus free to implement any
policy toward clients they choose. Clients can work with servers on any
network, in any location, implementing any policy, in any combination.</p>

<p>Octavia also scales down to intranets and LANs. In a sense, these
centrally-managed networks are special cases of the general, decentralized
case: the same mechanisms that work to associate clients and servers in a
decentralized manner also work in a centrally-managed deployment.</p>
