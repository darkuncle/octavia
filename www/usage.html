<h1><a href="index.html"><img src="8va.png" alt="Octavia" width="105" height="56" /></a>: HOWTO Use Octavia</h1>

<p>Currently, using Octavia is a bit unwieldy. Sorry about that. In the
future, it will be awesomer.<p>

<p>These instructions show you how to download and build Octavia, how to set
up a server and a client, and how to store and retrieve files with Octavia.
All the functionality is available on the command line
only&#x200A;—&#x200A;there is no graphical interface yet. There are
also a few bits of software you have to get first.</p>

<p><strong>Software Dependencies.</strong> You need the Java development kit
(JDK). How you get it is different depending on your operating system:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>On Mac OS X:</strong> You already have it because it comes with
OS X. You are done. Good work!</li>

<li><strong>On Windows:</strong> Go to <a
href="http://java.sun.com/">java.sun.com</a> and grab the latest JDK for
Windows. You want the full JDK, not just the JRE (Java runtime environment).
Once it’s downloaded, run the installer as usual.</li>

<li><strong>On Linux and Unix:</strong> Your system’s package manager
probably has some way to get it. Ubuntu and FreeBSD make this process only
somewhat more painful than it needs to be, so I recommend those systems. (By
“recommend” I mean “recommend you run screaming
from”, but nobody listens to me.)</li>

</ul>

<p>Once you have the JDK installed, you need a cryptography package for Java
called Bouncy Castle. Go to <a
href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">bouncycastle.org</a> and download the
Java (not the C#!) version of the package. You will get a JAR (.jar) file.
Store that somewhere reasonable, like in your home directory.</p>

<p>A command line shell program is already installed on your computer, no
matter what operating system you have. How you access it is different for
each, though:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>On Mac OS X:</strong> Run Terminal, found in
/Applications/Utilities.</li>

<li><strong>On Windows:</strong> Run cmd.exe by going to Start, then Run...,
then type “cmd.exe” (without the quotes) and hit Enter.</li>

<li><strong>On Linux and Unix:</strong> You’re probably already
familiar with the command line. <tt>:)</tt></li>

</ul>

<p>In the following instructions, I show examples of command line usage. I
use fairly standard conventions for command line documentation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong><tt>Strong typewriter text</tt></strong> shows stuff you type
in.
</li>

<li><tt>Regular typewriter text</tt> shows stuff the system prints to
you.</li>

<li>The canonical shell prompt is <tt>$</tt> for Unix-like systems, and
<tt>&gt;</tt> for Windows systems. Your system’s actual prompt is
probably different. In cases where it matters I’ll prefix the prompt
with <tt>client</tt> or <tt>server</tt> to indicate that you should run that
command on the client host or on the server host, respectively. Also,
I’ll generally use the Unix <tt>$</tt> prompt, even for Windows.</li>

</ul>

<p>Also note that from here on out, we’ll refer to Linux, Unix, and
Mac OS X all as “Unix-like systems” or even just
“Unix” for brevity.</p>

<p><strong>Set up the command line environment.</strong> You want the Java
programs to be in your PATH for convenience, and you need Bouncy Castle to
be in Java’s CLASSPATH. But before we can continue, I need to explain
some stuff about the command line. In your command shell, run the following
commands. (They are different for Windows than they are for Unix-like
systems.)</p>

<p>For Unix:</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>export CLASSPATH=".:$HOME/bcprov-jdk15-143.jar"</strong>
$ <strong>echo $CLASSPATH</strong>
.:/Users/chris/bcprov-jdk15-143.jar
</pre>

<p>For Windows:</p>

<pre>
&gt; <strong>set CLASSPATH .;%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\bcprov-jdk15-143.jar</strong>
&gt; <strong>echo %CLASSPATH%</strong>
.;\Users\chris\bcprov-jdk15-143.jar
</pre>


<h2>Download and Build the Octavia Software</h2>

<p><strong>First, download the latest version of Octavia</strong> from <a
href="octavia-hg.zip">http://www.wieldysoftware.com/octavia/octavia-hg.zip</a>.
Then, unzip the package and put the resulting directory somewhere that makes
sense to you. In the following examples, I’ll call the Octavia
directory “8va”.</p>

<p><strong>Next, build the software.</strong> This example assumes you have
the Java compiler, <var>javac</var>, in your PATH. For Unix:</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>cd 8va/src</strong>
$ <strong>./make</strong>
javac -Xlint octavia/BlockID.java
javac -Xlint octavia/Client.java
<em>...other Java files...</em>
</pre>

<p>And for Windows:</p>

<pre>
&gt; <strong>cd 8va\src</strong>
&gt; <strong>make.bat</strong>
javac -Xlint octavia/BlockID.java
javac -Xlint octavia/Client.java
<em>...other Java files...</em>
</pre>

<p><strong>Now install the Octavia properties file in your home
directory.</strong> The properties file tells Octavia its configuration
parameters. For Unix:</p>

<pre>
<em>Assuming you’re still in 8va/src after the previous command</em>
$ <strong>mkdir ~/.8va</strong>
$ <strong>cp 8va.properties ~/.8va/properties</strong>
</pre>

<p>And for Windows:</p>

<pre>
<em>Assuming you’re still in 8va\src after the previous command</em>
&gt; <strong>mkdir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\_8va</strong>
&gt; <strong>copy 8va.properties %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\_8va\properties</strong>
</pre>

<h3>Install Octavia on Clients <em>and</em> Servers</h3>

<p>The rest of this HOWTO has you running Octavia commands on clients and on
servers.</p>


<h2>Key Management</h2>

<p>Octavia clients and servers use cryptography to identify each other and
protect their communications from the depredations of maniacs on the
cybertubes. Octavia uses two kinds of keys.</p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>Signing keys</strong></dt>

<dd>

<p>Octavia clients and servers use signing keys to identify each other and
to prove things about their communications. Servers recognize clients by the
clients’ unique signing keys&#x200A;—&#x200A;that is, each
client has its own signing key that it shares with a server and with nobody
else.</p>

<p>Every client and every server maintains a <em>keystore</em> file
containing all the signing keys they know. A keystore file contains a list
of <var>name</var> = <var>value</var> pairs. The <var>name</var> is the name
of the key, and the <var>value</var> is the value itself (a string of random
bytes). There is a crucial difference between the keystores kept by servers
vs. those kept by clients: Server keystores use names that are meaningless
to humans but meaningful to Octavia, and clients use the server’s
hostname and port for the key name.</p>

</dd>

<dt><strong>Encryption keys</strong></dt>

<dd>

<p>Only Octavia clients use encryption keys. These keys are used in the
encryption algorithm that clients use to encrypt their data before sending
it across the internet to the servers. Every client maintains its own
encryption keys, keeping them secret even from the servers. Clients store
encryption keys in their <em>directory descriptors</em> (described
below).</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Generate a Client Key</h3>

<p>To set up a new Octavia client, you need to generate a new signing key.
Octavia’s <var>KeyManager</var> helps you generate and manage them.
You can get a help message from <var>KeyManager</var>:</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager</strong>
Usage: java octavia.KeyManager client|server command [...]

command can be one of:
    new                   -- create a new keystore
    show                  -- show all keys in the store
    show alias [...]      -- show one or more keys
    delete alias [...]    -- delete one or more keys by alias
    add alias             -- generate and insert a new key
    add key               -- insert the key; alias will be hash(key)
    add alias key         -- insert the new key
</pre>

<p>To generate a new client keystore and show that the new store contains no
keys, use the <var>new</var> and <var>show</var> commands. Use a password to
protect your keystore. <var>show</var> will print nothing since you have no
keys yet.</p>

<pre>
client $ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager client new</strong>
client $ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager client show</strong>
</pre>

<p>To add a new client key, supply an alias for it. The alias must be the
hostname and port of the server you want to register with, formatted like
so: <tt><em>hostname</em>:<em>port</em></tt>.</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager client add localhost:55555</strong>
$ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager client show</strong>
localhost:55555 fb8325bf789f0533708094218cf85d8c <em>more bytes...</em>
</pre>

<h3>Register the Client Key With a Server</h3>

<p>Now that your client keystore has a signing key, you need to get the key
installed in the server’s keystore so that the server can recognize
the client. This implies, of course, that you somehow copied the client key
to the server host. Currently, that little detail is “out of
band” for Octavia; you could use <var>scp</var>(1), email, encrypted
email, a web app of your own devising, et c. We know that is dumb and will
definitely fix it someday. For now though, you have to do it by hand.</p>

<pre>
server $ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager server new</strong>
server $ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager server add fb8325bf789f0533708094218cf85d8c <em>more bytes...</em></strong>
server $ <strong>java octavia.KeyManager server show</strong>
092d3a7116bec419 <em>more bytes...</em> 6ed1d516f4c5d23cd7a51 <em>more bytes...</em>
</pre>



<h2>Start the Server</h2>

<p>This, at least, is pretty easy:</p>

<pre>
server $ <strong>java octavia.Server</strong>
</pre>

<p>If your system has <var>tail</var>(1) (any Unix system, and Windows
systems with Cygwin installed), you can watch your Octavia log file:</p>

<pre>
server $ <strong> tail -f ~/.8va/log</strong>
1265351670979 I Using crypto provider BC version 1.43
1265351671006 I Loaded KeyStore from /Users/chris/.8va/server.keystore. Key aliases: 01cec5c86ce4878bbe8f82e5b16734d63df71121370f19cec7cfdaf3985401de, 
1265351671010 M Octavia version 20091201 'Neck Pickup' listening on /0.0.0.0:55555. Get ready for fun!
</pre>

<p>On Windows without tail, you can always just blast out the whole
thing:</p>

<pre>
server &gt; <strong>type %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\_8va\log</strong>
1265351670979 I Using crypto provider BC version 1.43
1265351671006 I Loaded KeyStore from /Users/chris/.8va/server.keystore. Key aliases: 01cec5c86ce4878bbe8f82e5b16734d63df71121370f19cec7cfdaf3985401de, 
1265351671010 M Octavia version 20091201 'Neck Pickup' listening on /0.0.0.0:55555. Get ready for fun!
</pre>


<h2>Using the Client</h2>

<p>First, you need to create a new root directory descriptor. For that, we
use the <em>mkroot</em> command. <em>mkroot</em> prints the new descriptor
to the standard output, so in the shell you’ll want to redirect that
to a file (<em>rt</em> in this example).  I assume your Octavia server runs
on the host octavia.example.com, listening on port 55555.</p>

<pre>
client $ <strong>java octavia.Client</strong>
Usage: java octavia.Client directory-descriptor[/path] command
[arguments...]
Usage: java octavia.Client mkroot server:port [server2:port2...]

command can be one of:
    fetch file [...]          -- fetch one or more files
    mkdir path                -- create a new subdirectory
    mkroot server:port [...]  -- create a new root descriptor
    status                    -- print the status of all files and directories
    status file [...]         -- print the status of the named files and
                                 directories
    store file [...]          -- store the named files

client $ <strong>java octavia.Client mkroot octavia.example.com:55555 &gt; rt</strong>
client $ <strong>cat rt</strong>
protocol-version 0
encryption-key 12ac4a6d2453fde2d7d222b6c1b75b49
servers octavia.example.com:55555 
version my-laptop.example.com 4b6c6922
</pre>

<p>Every action you do with the Octavia client will involve a directory
descriptor. Verify that your new root is indeed empty (<em>status</em>
prints nothing):</p>

<pre>
client $ <strong>java octavia.Client rt status</strong>
</pre>

<p>Finally! Here is how to store a file in Octavia:</p>

<pre>
client $ <strong>cat TODO.txt</strong>
Change to SHA512 for the block ID hash algorithm! Should we also use
HMAC-SHA512 for signing?

Make a convenience method of Octavia.storeBlock, or simplify the one, as
necessary.

Create Octavia.encrypt and Octavia.decrypt convenience methods; rename the
current .encrypt.

Curly quotes for all Javadoc

Should Util.blockName be blockID.fileName?

Write StorageResponse.toString.

Create DeletionRequest/Response and ExistRequest/Response
client $ <strong>java octavia.Client rt store TODO.txt &gt; rt2</strong>
client $ <strong>cat rt2</strong>
protocol-version 0
encryption-key 7d9a6af925685ce7740efd5c9a4c1e89
servers octavia.example.com:55555 
f TODO.txt 1c9 1253e341390
      1c9 032e52300682be7b71f15af3d9796aa3dfbb38b3799f206d74f4348490f8072f0ab3b2601b5eba172b8f3ca9b87c9edbe04a7b2d497e74c163781a96cbc9e428
version my-laptop.example.com 0
</pre>

<p>Note that when we store, a new directory descriptor is written to
standard out and we save it as a new file, <em>rt2</em>. Let’s check
the server log to see what happened when we stored the file:</p>

<pre>
server $ <strong>tail ~/.8va/log</strong>
1265398431191 D { v 0, type StorageRequest, keyID 110917a9de6b4c86d538c38bf32634da7c9fe997efece92125cd3443e3be84ed171f5a14160dda19d9e4edde2344d7843d68ae44cd5695e69ce265cc692ef0cd, signature 406cf78a3de45cc8f422a90ffb60cdeef655509fdc96c18131064eeed9dbd007f33d4788b42b72a50f91da09a5eb01f4f7e06117165d331667e0a70f0e48eacd, size 457, nonce 4b231ccbef5f96cf, data 4a09b80031f8862b... }
1265398431197 I Stored new block 032e52300682be7b/71f15af3d9796aa3/dfbb38b3799f206d/74f4348490f8072f/0ab3b2601b5eba17/2b8f3ca9b87c9edb/e04a7b2d497e74c1/63781a96cbc9e428-1c9 
</pre>

<p>In this case we see that the server saw our storage request, and stored
our file as one block of data.</p>

<p>Now let’s fetch the file back. Make sure to reference the new
descriptor <em>rt2</em>, not the old <em>rt</em>:</p>

<pre>
client $ <strong>java octavia.Client rt2 status</strong>
       457    Sat Nov 28 20:30:18 PST 2009    TODO.txt
client $ <strong>java octavia.Client rt2 fetch TODO.txt</strong>
Change to SHA512 for the block ID hash algorithm! Should we also use
HMAC-SHA512 for signing?

Make a convenience method of Octavia.storeBlock, or simplify the one, as
necessary.

Create Octavia.encrypt and Octavia.decrypt convenience methods; rename the
current .encrypt.

Curly quotes for all Javadoc

Should Util.blockName be blockID.fileName?

Write StorageResponse.toString.

Create DeletionRequest/Response and ExistRequest/Response
